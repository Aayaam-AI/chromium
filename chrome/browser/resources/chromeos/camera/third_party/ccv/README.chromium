Local Modifications:
1. Fixed the path in ccv.js for the web worker to work in the Camera app's
   directory structure.
2. Caching workers instead of creating them for each invocation.
3. Loading the cascade directly from faces.js in the worker to avoid passing
   the entire object over IPC for every frame.
